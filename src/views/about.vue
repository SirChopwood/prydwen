  <div class="pt-4 text-primary font-bold text-3xl">Hi there!</div>
  <div class="w-full flex justify-center"><img src="/images/profilepicture.png" class="w-32 h-auto my-2 rounded-lg"></div>
  <br>
  I was born and raised in the south-east of England, obsessed with computers and games. Not to mention loving my three cats.
  <br>
  I've been a lifelong Sci-fi nerd with a keen interest for anything set a long time ago in a galaxy, far far away.
  <br><br>
  I have just completed my Degree at Staffordshire University earning a MEng (Hons) Computer Games Design.
  <br>
  Much of my time was spent learning and specialising in using Unreal Engine.
  <br><br>
  For the last 10+ years I have been making mods for some of my favourite games,
  <br>
  Including Garry's Mod, Arma 3, Battlefront 2 and Satisfactory.
  <br><br>
  Recently I've made a name for myself in the VRC VTubing scene.
  <br>
  Making friends and sharing experiences in worlds we can all create.
